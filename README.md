Yet, they possess unique strengths ‚Äî creativity, innovation, and boundless energy ‚Äî that can be harnessed to make learning both effective and enjoyable.

- **Providing personalized learning tools** to accommodate various learning needs.
- **Reducing anxiety** through interactive and soothing games.
